Hi ducks! Today we are going to learn how to output "Hello World" to your screen using Python.

For this tutorial, I'd recommend you use [online-python][online-python]. This will allow us to practice writing code online, without actually needing to install python.

Online Python gives us some example code to play with, but today we are not going to be using this, so we should remove it. In main.py, remove the existing code. Main.py is where we will be writing our code. When we run the code, the output will be shown in the box under the "run" button.

Next, type the line:
{% highlight python %}
print("Hello world!")
{% endhighlight %}

It's really important to make sure that `print` is lowercase, and that you have correctly matched your opening and closing brackets. The same goes for your quotation marks.

We're going to click the "Run" button below this box, and run the program. And, if all goes well, you should get the following output!

{% highlight none %}
Hello world!
{% endhighlight %}

You can change the text in the quotation marks to whatever you would like, and it should be printed to the screen. We are using the `print` function, and its purpose is to display text to the user. Once you've got the hang of this, feel free to move onto the next tutorial!
